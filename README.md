as you can see on the headline it's about dss for stocks recommedation with top 10 global stocks, and I'm using yahoo finance/google finance for the data stocks historical data and I'm using AHP methods: 

10 data stocks that I used for my dss:
stocks = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'TSLA', 'NVDA', 'META', 'IBM', 'SONY', 'BABA']

use this 'import yfinance as yf' for fetch the data
